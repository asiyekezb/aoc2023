# Advent of Code 2017

## Questions

- Is `GeneralPurposeAllocator` a singleton? Should I care about reusing my instance?

## Day 1

- Had to Google how to read a file line-by-line in Zig.
- I'm not getting autocomplete or quickinfo in VS Code. Is this expected or broken?
  - Opening VS Code in the root directory for the day made it work as expected.
  - There's syntax highlighting but no language service from the root aoc directory
- I was surprised that `std.debug.print` takes a tuple as its second arg. Are there no varargs in Zig?
- I had a bug where I was adding the `u8` ASCII values of the digits, not the numeric values.
- You can do `zig run src/main.zig -- input.txt` to pass args to the program, but it doesn't cache between builds.
- Second star was very speedy after all the setup for the first!

## Day 2

I'm not sure what the best way to set up the Zig build system for multi-day AoC is. I made `src/day1.zig` and `src/day2.zig` and updated `build.zig` to use a for loop. This produces two output binaries. I think this works, but maybe I should have a single binary that takes "day" as an argument? Do I have to change `build.zig` every time I add a source file? This is a part of C that I don't love.

Concatenating strings was kinda painful! You need an allocator to do it, which I guess makes sense. I'm not sure why my first attempt with `std.fmt.bufPrint` failed.

I had a `null` vs. `undefined` bug! You have to initialize optionals to `null` rather than `undefined`.

For part 2 I'm implementing `readInts` using an `ArrayList`. Zig found a memory leak (I forgot to deallocate the ArrayList). Pretty cool!

Zig error handling is interesting. If your function returns `!void`, then you can just stick `try` in front of any statement that could error and its error returns will be added to your error returns.

I'm thinking I should at least try the mono-binary approach. It's supposed to be a build _graph_, right? Hopefully the days I'm not working on will be cached.

The Zig Build System / module documentation is pretty poor: https://ziglearn.org/chapter-3/
There's no explanation of what `zig.mod` is, for example.

Setting each day up as a module works fine. It's a little verbose (for each day I have to add a line to `build.zig` and an `if` statement to `main.zig`) but not so terrible. See 3dc252e for my failed attempt to rework this using a hash map of function pointers.
